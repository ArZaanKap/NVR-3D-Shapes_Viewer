im looking to build a website that works on laptop, pc, ipad and phones seamlessly. it will be a tool to visualise 3d shapes to help students prepare for the nonverbal reasoning section of the uk's 11+ exam. there is an example attached. the website should be minimal and fully functional, just the title with the tool underneath. the tool will be a simple CAD like blank world where i can drag and drop the basic 3D shapes into the world. there should be a clipping mechanism so each new shape can attach to a face of ones already in the world (a little preview of where the new shape will attach should be shown while im dragging the new shape around the world before placing- the faces should get temporary colour instead of being default grey colour). there should be a reset button to clear the world and a delete button to delete a shape when i have selected it. after dragging and dropping and arranging the basic shapes into my desired compound shape, i should be able to then view it from different angles. 1 way will be the standard cube viewer thing present in all CAD software (like fusion in top right) where i get exact views from front, side back... etc when clicking on sections of the cube - the viewer cube normally has small text on it saying front back right left. 2nd way is just dragging the world which will rotate the viewing camera. make sure i can zoom in and out too. add gmail login to start off and keep record of my users (ask 1 question - what's your nickname so we can greet them when they are using the tool - making sure this nickname is remembered and not asked for more than once). add a xyz axis thing at origin, make it small. make sure the shapes dragged into the world snap to the world grid. add rotation and translation tools when i select a block (gimbal) just like fusion 360 has. make sure theres a cursor button at the top to help me deselect anything and go back to normal viewing mode. the basic shapes are all seen in the image attached - cubes and cuboids 1x1x1, 1x1x2, 1x1x3; L shapes short and long; T shapes short and long. make sure the shapes panel has 3d thumbnails for each shape.
in terms of outlining, i need a bold black outline for each edge of each shape, to help distinguish the blocks that make up the larger assembled shape. rotation should be in 90deg increments only. make rotation friendly in terms of ui for children.

any other questions?
